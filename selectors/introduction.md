# Introduction

## Description

Selectors define a path through a set of data.

Selectors are made up of different parts separated by a dot `.`, each part being used to identify the next node in the chain.

## Escaping

You can escape values in selectors using a backslash `\`. The main use for this is to allow you to target fields that contain a dot or space in their name.
